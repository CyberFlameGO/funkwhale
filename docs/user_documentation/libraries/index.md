# Libraries

Libraries enable you to organize audio content you upload to your {term}`pod`. You can set the privacy level on libraries to control who can access them. Choose from the available privacy levels:

- **Everyone, across all instances** – the library's content is available to everybody who interacts with your pod. This includes users of other pods.
- **Everyone on this instance** – the library's content is available to all users on your pod. This does not include users of other pods.
- **Nobody except me** – the library's content is only available to you and people you share the library with.

Use libraries for private collections or freely licensed music you want to share.
