"Funkwhale doesn't delete data objects from the database when you delete a"
" file. This is because they might exist in users' playlists, favorites, "
"and listening history. These objects might also be present in another "
"user's private libraries."

"To help with this, the {file}`manage.py` script includes commands to "
"prune dangling metadata from your database. All prune commands are "
"available under the python manage.py prune_library namespace. To ensure "
"you don't remove data by accident, all commands run in dry run mode by "
"default. Run commands with the `--no-dry-run` flag to perform the pruning"
" action."
