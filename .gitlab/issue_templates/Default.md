<!--

Hello and welcome to our issue tracker! You are interested in helping us to
improve Funkwhale and we are really glad you take the efforts!

At first, lets look into the right way to submit your thoughts:

* If you are looking for support setting up or using Funkwhale, please consider
	using our [Support Forum](https://forum.funkwhale.audio/support) or our [Matrix support
	channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#funkwhale-support:tchncs.de).
* In case you suspect to found a bug, one of the above channels might be a good
	starting point to validate it, but its also fine to go ahead and report a bug.
	Please make sure you are using the Bug template in the dropdown above.
* For smaller additions or feature enhancements, please file a feature request
	with the template here. 
* If you have ideas how to extend Funkwhale by completely new features or use
	cases, please consider starting a thread in our
	[forum](https://forum.funkwhale.audio/t/development). This way we can have a
	discussion if this feature is possible or wanted by the community and create
	tasks for our development team to work towards those goals.

Again: Thank you a lot for considering to submit your ideas and thoughts. Its
really appreciated! If in doubt, please just hit the submit button anyways so we
can sort it out together.

Happy listening! :whale:
